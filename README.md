 Solutions for AdventOfCode2021

These are just my personal solutions for AdventOfCode2021. Some notes, they are:

	- Probably not the fastest/easiest solutions by a long shot
	- Probably not going to be posted to github any time within a few hours of the problem going public. (I've got a job and a need to sleep, after all)
	- All in F#, in which I am not an expert
	
I'm using these problems as an excuse to learn F#. We'll see how far I can get with a language I'm "new" to.
